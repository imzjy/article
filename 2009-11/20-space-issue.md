Fucking on [non-breakable space] and [trailing space]
========

Blow are simple explanation on non-breakable space and trailing space.

### non-breakable space

- It's hard to type non-breakable space when you are typing.
- It's invisible character.
- It's 0xa0(hex),160(digit), in some encoding systems. 
- reference: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-breaking_space

### trailing space

- It's just like:
  `abc[][][][end of line]   #three trailing space represent as []`
- the whitespace between last character and end of line. 

Notes:

Brushing up on [whitespace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_%28computer_science%29) in computer science.
