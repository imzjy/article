百无聊奈
======

How time flys! Today is sunday, but in last year it must be saturday. One years paased! I stay alone in the the same place. Outwardly， I think I learn to accept this and live with silence. Obviously,It's wrong. I told myself a man must be strong one more times.sometimes I also asked myself: why I couldn't leave away? What I persist? I don't know until now. Is it fooling?

One day or another, I'll be in the love as like as last year. Whatever, I think I can't have passion as like as last year. I exhausted my power. Love isn't like that we think about it, as she said.

In the love, one words in my heart is "Don't love me isn't permit !". I had told she it, yet I told it to myself in fact.

The disorder in the room, can be cleaned. The disorder in the mind, how does cleaning it up?
